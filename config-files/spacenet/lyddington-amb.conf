# Description on the space-net site:
#
# St Andrew’s Church, built in the 14th Century, has one of the finest
# examples of in-situ acoustic jars (vases or pots) in the UK. These
# jars were common to European church construction in the late Middle
# Ages and are said to be based on the ideas of Roman architect Vitruvius,
# who discussed the use of resonant jars in the design of amphitheatres
# to provide clarity of voice presentation. They are designed as Helmholtz
# resonators, giving narrow band energy absorption according to the natural
# frequency of the jar although there is little conclusive acoustical
# evidence to show that they behave as designed. Studies suggest that the
# success or otherwise of these devices depends on the number of jars used
# and their placement, as well as the characteristics of the building and
# jars themselves. In anechoic and reverberant chambers the absorption
# effects of such jars are weak and highly selective, although can be
# significant below 200Hz. Together with their additional diffusive effects,
# the jars potentially help to eliminate strong normal modes and hence can
# be made effective with careful tuning and positioning. St Andrew’s Church
# has 11 jars placed high in the chancel, 6 in the north wall and 5 in the
# south, arranged at irregular intervals such that there are no directly
# opposite pairs.

# Comments (FA):
#
# The two original WAV files had a 6-line text preamble which had to
# be removed to make them readable as regular WAV files. They have
# been combined into a single 4-ch WAVEX file using makemulti, without
# any further changes. You can also use the two original files after
# removing the text preamble.
#
# Measuring and viewing the responses revealed what are probably gain
# errors in the equipment used to capture the responses. These are 
# approximately corrected by the gain factors used below.
#
# The offset of 2055 samples cuts off the direct sound and the first
# 5 ms of the response.
