# jconvolver configuration -- Hamilton Mausoleum, Scotland.

#
# Description on the space-net site:
#
# Construction on the Hamilton Mausoleum, Hamilton, Scotland, built
# for the 10th Duke of Hamilton, started in 1842 and was completed
# in 1858. It is constructed of marble and sandstone and is surmounted
# by a dome 36m in height, with two main spaces, a crypt in the lower
# section, and a chapel that was supposed to be used for worship.
# However the construction materials, size, shape and dimensions of the
# latter result in a complex, dense and very long reverberation, and
# hence render it almost useless for speech presentation. In fact the
# Guinness Book of World Records claims that the Hamilton Mausoleum has
# the longest “echo” of any building, recorded on 27 May 1994 as taking
# 15s for the sound of the reverberation caused by slamming one of the
# main doors to die away to nothing. The space is now often used by
# recording musicians for its unique acoustic properties. The interior
# of Hamilton Mausoleum is approximately octagonal in plan, with a
# diameter of 18 m. Each side of the octagon is either a plane wall or
# a further semicircular alcove. The results presented below having the
# microphone assembly in the centre and the source placed to one side,
# just outside one of the alcoves, giving a source-receiver distance
# of 4.8 m.

# Comments (FA):
#
# The two original WAV files have been combined into a single 4-ch
# WAVEX file using makemulti, without any further changes. You can
# also use the originals.
#
# Measuring and viewing the responses revealed what are probably gain
# errors in the equipment used to capture the responses. These are 
# approximately corrected by the gain factors used below.
#
# The offset of 786 samples cuts off the direct sound and the first
# 5 ms of the response.
