# "Super-Stereo", by Michael A. Gerzon (according to a sursound posting
# by Richard Lee), as used on MINIM Ambisonic decoders.
#
# This matrix converts a normal stereo signal into horizontal B-format for
# Ambisonic playback, creating a wider sound stage by wrapping the image
# around the listener.
#
# M = L + R, S = L - R
#
# W = 0.3667 M + j 0.3586 S
# X = 0.5290 M - j 0.4040 S
# Y = S
#
# The 'j' coefficient denotes a +90 degrees phase shift, implemented
# using a Hilbert transform IR. As this introduces latency, it is
# essential to delay the real part accordingly. The Hilbert transform
# used here has a lenght of 4096 samples and a delay of 2048 samples.
