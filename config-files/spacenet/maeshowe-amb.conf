# jconvolver configuration -- Maes-Howe, Orkney, UK.
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# Origin of IR files: http://space-net.org.uk/node/51
#
# Description on the space-net site:
#
# Maes-Howe, Orkney, is one of the finest chambered cairns in Europe,
# and is dated to 3000BC.  Prior work in the acoustics of ancient sites
# explores how the resonances exhibited therein might have affected
# regular human ritual and interaction with the space.  It has been
# hypothesized that as these resonances are within the lower male vocal
# range, they may have been used in ritual to accentuate aspects of the
# voice.  Unlike many similar ancient structures that have been studied
# to date, Maes Howe lends itself to the presence of strong modal
# frequencies.  It is almost cubic in shape, of dimension 4.6m, with
# walls made from large, flat slabs of stone, resulting in smooth
# reflecting surfaces rather than more commonly found irregular placement
# of smaller stones.
#
# Location: Orkney, Scotland, UK
# Size (Approx): 100m3

# Source: Log. Swept Sine; 20-22k Hz; 15s long
# Input: Genelec S30D
# Source Location: Centre of chamber
# Mic Location: Centre of wall opposite entrance
# Source-Microphone Distance: 2m
# Microphone: Soundfield SPS-422B

#
# Comments (FA):
#
# The two original WAV files had a 6-line text preamble which had to
# be removed to make them readable as regular WAV files. They have
# been combined into a single 4-ch WAVEX file using makemulti, without
# any further changes. You can also use the two original files after
# removing the text preamble.
#
# Measuring and viewing the responses revealed what are probably gain
# errors in the equipment used to capture the responses. These are 
# approximately corrected by the gain factors used below.
#
# The offset of 385 samples cuts off the direct sound and the first
# 5 ms of the response.
